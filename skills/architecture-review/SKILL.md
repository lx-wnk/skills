description: >-
  Review system-level architecture of a PR, branch, namespace, or whole project — boundary violations,
  dependency cycles, layer breaches, ADR compliance, cohesion of modules and bounded contexts.
  Make sure to use this skill whenever the user asks to review the architecture, audit module boundaries,
  check for circular dependencies, verify domain structure, or says things like "architektur-review",
  "prüfe die struktur", "check architecture", "review namespace", "audit boundaries", "are our modules clean".
  Use this skill for HIGH-LEVEL structural review only — SOLID, class design, and method-level issues belong in `component-review`.

# Architecture Review (System Level)

Audit structural health: boundaries, dependency direction, layering, ADR drift. Report findings — never modify code.

## Scope

**In scope:** module/context boundaries, dependency cycles, layer violations, namespace cohesion, public-API surface leaks, shared-model pollution, drift from documented ADRs.

**Out of scope:** SOLID inside a class, naming of private methods, style, line-level bugs (→ `component-review` or general code review).

## Examples

```bash
# Review architecture of a specific PR
/architecture-review pr 42

# Review a branch against main
/architecture-review branch feat/orders-refactor

# Focus on a single namespace/module
/architecture-review namespace src/Order

# Review the whole project
/architecture-review
```

## Workflow

  A["Parse target mode"] --> B["Load project context"]

  C --> D["Build dependency map"]
  D --> E["Run checks"]
  E --> F["Report findings"]
```

## Phase 1: Parse Target

From `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `pr <N>` → `gh pr diff <N>`, `gh pr view <N> --json headRefName,files`, read full file context via `git show <branch>:<file>`
- `branch <name>` → `git diff main...<name>`, `git ls-tree -r <name>`, read files via `git show <branch>:<file>`
- `namespace <path>` → recursively read files under `<path>`
- empty → full-project review (sample entry points + top-level modules)

## Phase 2: Load Project Context

Check in order:

1. `.agent-context/layer1-bootstrap.md`, `layer2-project-core.md`
2. `.agent-context/decisions.json` → ADRs that define intended structure
3. `docs/architecture/**/*.md`
4. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
5. Manifest files for stack detection

Never block on missing context — infer from code layout.

## Phase 3: Build Dependency Map

Per detected stack, extract imports/uses:

- **PHP/Symfony/Shopware** → `use` statements, PSR-4 namespaces from `composer.json`
- **TypeScript/JavaScript/Vue/Nuxt** → `import` statements, path aliases from `tsconfig.json`/`nuxt.config`
- **Go** → `import` blocks, module path from `go.mod`
- **Java/Kotlin** → `import` + package declarations
- **Python** → `import`/`from`, top-level packages

Group imports by top-level module/namespace. Flag:

- Imports that cross declared module boundaries
- Imports going "upward" in a layered architecture
- Imports into another module's internal/private sub-path

## Phase 4: Architectural Checks

Run each relevant check and record findings with `file:line`:

### 1. Dependency Direction

- Layered: higher layers may import lower, never the reverse
- Hexagonal: adapters → ports → domain (never domain → adapters)
- Modular: module A imports only B's public API, never `internal/`

### 2. Circular Dependencies

- Build a module-level graph, detect cycles
- Even acceptable cycles should be listed as risks

### 3. Boundary Cohesion

- Does each module have a single clear responsibility?
- Public API surface: how many files/classes does an outside caller touch?
- "God module" symptom: one module imported by almost everything

### 4. Shared Model Pollution

- Domain entities reused across bounded contexts without translation
- Shared "Common" / "Util" module growing unbounded

### 5. ADR Drift

- For each ADR in `decisions.json` or `docs/architecture/adr/`: does the current code still match?
- Flag the specific ADR ID and the divergent file

### 6. Framework Convention Drift

- Use `WebFetch` / Context7 for current-version best practices when the stack version matters
- Example: Nuxt 3 server/client boundary, Symfony bundle structure, Go `internal/`

### 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Is auth enforced at a single seam or scattered?
- Is logging/observability concentrated or repeated ad-hoc?

## Phase 5: Report

Output in the user's language. Structure:

```markdown
## Architecture Review — <scope>

**Risk Level:** LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
**Detected stack:** <stack>
**Checks run:** <list>

## Critical (must fix)

- **<Title>** — `path/to/file:line`
  - Problem: <what>
  - Why it matters: <impact>
  - Suggested direction: <high-level fix, not code>

## Warnings (should fix)

- ...

## Observations (worth knowing)

- ...

## ADR Compliance

| ADR                   | Status      | Notes                              |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ADR-0003 Hexagonal    | ✅ ok       |                                    |
| ADR-0007 No shared DB | ⚠️ drifting | `OrderRepo` touches billing tables |

## Rules

- **Read-only.** Never modify source files. Findings are reports.
- **Structural focus.** If the only findings are code-quality issues, recommend `component-review` instead.
- **Evidence-based.** Every finding needs a concrete `file:line` reference.
- **Prioritize.** Not every boundary leak is critical — severity matters more than count.
- **Fallback, don't block.** Missing ADRs or context layers → infer intent from code layout.
- **Ignore style.** Linters and formatters own that territory.
